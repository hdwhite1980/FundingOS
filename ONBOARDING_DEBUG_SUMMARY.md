# Onboarding Persistence Debugging Summary

## Issue
After completing onboarding and reaching the dashboard, refreshing the page sends the user back to onboarding instead of staying on the dashboard.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be that either:
1. The profile is not being saved with `setup_completed: true` in the database
2. The profile API is not returning the correct data
3. There's a timing issue between save and refresh
4. There's a caching issue preventing fresh data retrieval

## Changes Made for Debugging

### 1. Enhanced Logging in app/page.js
- Added detailed console logs in `checkUserProfile()` to track:
  - API response status
  - Profile data returned from API
  - `setup_completed` field values
  - `needsOnboarding` state changes

- Added detailed logging in `handleOnboardingComplete()` to track:
  - Profile data received from onboarding
  - State updates

- Added profile re-check mechanism after onboarding completion

### 2. Enhanced Logging in EnhancedOnboardingFlow.js
- Added logging for profile data being saved
- Added logging for `setup_completed` value before save
- Added logging for profile data after successful save
- Added 100ms delay after save to ensure database transaction completion

### 3. API Route Improvements in /api/user/profile/[userId]/route.js
- Added no-cache headers to prevent browser caching
- Ensured consistent response format

### 4. Removed Authorization Header
- Simplified API call to avoid potential token issues

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`

2. **Complete onboarding process**:
   - Go through all onboarding steps
   - Watch browser console for logs during save:
     - "Profile data being saved: [object]"
     - "setup_completed value: true"  
     - "Profile saved successfully: [object]"
     - "Saved profile setup_completed: true"

3. **Check onboarding completion**:
   - Watch for "HomePage: Onboarding completed with profile: [object]"
   - Verify "HomePage: Profile setup_completed value: true"
   - Should see dashboard after completion

4. **Test persistence by refreshing**:
   - Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   - Watch console logs:
     - "HomePage: Checking user profile for [userId]"
     - "HomePage: API response status: 200"
     - "HomePage: API returned profile: [object]"
     - "HomePage: Profile found and setup completed: true"
     - "HomePage: Setting needsOnboarding to: false"

5. **Expected vs Actual Behavior**:
   - **Expected**: Dashboard remains after refresh
   - **If bug persists**: Logs will show where the issue occurs

## Debugging Tools Created

- `test-profile-api.js`: Manual API endpoint testing
- `debug-onboarding-persistence.js`: Debug guide and checklist
- `test-onboarding-persistence.js`: Database profile verification

## Next Steps Based on Logs

### If profile saves with setup_completed: false
- Issue is in the onboarding save logic
- Check database schema for setup_completed field
- Verify upsert operation

### If profile saves correctly but API returns setup_completed: false
- Issue is in the API route
- Check database connection and query

### If API returns correct data but UI still shows onboarding
- Issue is in the UI state management
- Check component re-rendering logic

### If logs show inconsistent behavior
- May be a timing/race condition
- Consider adding more delays or state synchronization

## Files Modified
- `app/page.js`: Enhanced debugging and re-check logic
- `components/EnhancedOnboardingFlow.js`: Enhanced save logging and delay
- `app/api/user/profile/[userId]/route.js`: No-cache headers
- Created test files for manual verification
