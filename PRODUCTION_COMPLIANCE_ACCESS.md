# üéØ How to Access Compliance in Production

## Quick Access

### Method 1: Direct URL
Simply navigate to: **`/ufa`** in your browser

Examples:
- If your app is at `https://your-app.vercel.app`, go to:
  - **`https://your-app.vercel.app/ufa`**

### Method 2: Add Navigation Button (Recommended)

The Compliance dashboard is on the `/ufa` page, but there's currently no link from the main dashboard to access it. Here are your options:

---

## Option A: Manual Navigation (Immediate)
1. Log into your app
2. In the browser address bar, add `/ufa` to the end of your URL
3. Press Enter
4. Click the **"Compliance"** tab

---

## Option B: Add Navigation Link to Dashboard (Recommended)

I can add a navigation button to your main dashboard that links to the UFA/Compliance page. This would make it easily accessible for all users.

Where would you like the link?
1. **In the header** next to other navigation items
2. **As a tab** in the main dashboard tabs
3. **As a card** on the overview page
4. **In the sidebar** (if you have one)

## Verifying Production Deployment

To confirm everything is deployed:

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find your FundingOS project
   - Check that the latest commit is deployed
   - Latest commit should be: `ba4a1aa - docs: Add comprehensive compliance verification...`

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Navigate to `/ufa` then click Compliance tab
   - You should see API call to `/api/compliance?userId=...`
   - If it returns data = ‚úÖ Working!
   - If it returns 404 = Database not deployed yet
