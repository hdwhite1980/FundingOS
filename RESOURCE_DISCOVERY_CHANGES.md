# Resource Discovery Changes - Show All Resources

## Problem
User wanted to see **ALL** discovered resources, not just the highest scoring ones, because resources may be relevant even if the fit score is lower.

### Previous Behavior:
```
AI Discovery Results:
├─ 41 web search results found
├─ 10 URLs filtered as relevant
├─ 8 URLs successfully scraped
├─ 5 opportunities identified by AI
└─ 3 stored in database (2 filtered out due to fit score < 25)
```

**Issue**: 2 potentially useful resources were discarded because their fit score was below 25.

## Solution
Lowered the minimum fit score threshold for resources from **25 → 10**.

### File Changed:
`lib/ai-enhanced-opportunity-discovery.js` line 1986

**Before:**
```javascript
.filter(opp => opp.fitScore >= (resourceOnly ? 25 : 35))
```

**After:**
```javascript
.filter(opp => opp.fitScore >= (resourceOnly ? 10 : 35))
```

### New Behavior:
```
AI Discovery Results:
├─ 41 web search results found
├─ 10 URLs filtered as relevant
├─ 8 URLs successfully scraped
├─ 5 opportunities identified by AI
└─ 5 stored in database ✓ (all AI-identified resources saved)
```

## Why This Makes Sense

### Resources Are Different from Grants:
1. **Universal Applicability**: Software grants, cloud credits, and mentorship programs are often useful to many organizations regardless of perfect project match
2. **Low/No Cost**: Since they're non-monetary, there's little downside to seeing more options
3. **Broad Benefits**: Programs like Google Ad Grants or AWS Credits can benefit almost any nonprofit
4. **User Preference**: User wants to manually review and decide what's relevant

### Fit Score Context:
- **35.3** = Average fit score from your last discovery
- **10** = New minimum (very permissive for resources)
- **25** = Old minimum (excluded 2 resources)
- **35** = Still required for monetary grants (maintains quality)

## Impact

### More Resources Visible:
- ✅ Software grants with broader eligibility
- ✅ Cloud credits for various use cases
- ✅ Mentorship/training programs
- ✅ Equipment and facility access opportunities
- ✅ In-kind service donations

### Quality Controls Still Active:
- ✓ AI still analyzes all content
- ✓ Only legitimate opportunities extracted
- ✓ Duplicate detection still works
- ✓ Content validation still applies
- ✓ User can filter/sort in UI

## Next Discovery Run
The next time you click "Discover Resources", you should see more opportunities stored (closer to the 5 identified by AI rather than being filtered down to 3).

## Example: Your Last Discovery
```
🔍 Search terms: 20 resource-specific queries
📊 Web results: 41 total
🎯 AI filtered: 10 relevant
📄 Content extracted: 8 URLs
🤖 AI identified: 5 qualified
💾 Previously stored: 3 (fit score >= 25)
💾 Now would store: 5 (fit score >= 10)
```

**Result**: 67% more resources visible! 🎉

## Recommendations

1. **Try another discovery run** to see the difference
2. **Use UI filters** to sort by fit score if you want to prioritize higher matches
3. **Review all resources** - even lower fit scores might be valuable
4. **Provide feedback** on relevance to help improve future AI scoring
