# Compliance Integration for WALI-OS Assistant

## Overview
The WALI-OS Assistant now includes comprehensive compliance tracking capabilities, allowing users to monitor obligations, deadlines, documents, and regulatory requirements through natural language conversations.

## Features Added

### 1. Automatic Compliance Data Loading
- **Fetch on Open**: When the assistant opens, it automatically loads compliance data from `/api/compliance`
- **Smart Caching**: Data is cached for 5 minutes to reduce API calls; force refresh available
- **Background Sync**: Compliance data syncs with the assistant manager for global access

### 2. Natural Language Compliance Queries
Users can ask about compliance using natural language:
- "Show my compliance status"
- "Do I have any compliance alerts?"
- "Run a compliance check"
- "What's my compliance score?"
- "Are there any overdue items?"

### 3. Proactive Compliance Alerts
The assistant can be triggered proactively when:
- Compliance items become overdue
- Documents expire
- Critical alerts are generated
- Compliance score drops below threshold

**Trigger Example:**
```javascript
assistantManager.triggerContextualAssistant('compliance_alert', {
  overdueCount: 3,
  expiredDocs: 1
})
```

### 4. Interactive Compliance Actions
- **Run Checks**: Assistant can execute compliance checks via API
- **View Details**: Provides formatted compliance overview with scores and status
- **Alert Management**: Surfaces active alerts and recommendations

## Usage Examples

### User Queries
```
User: "What's my compliance status?"
Assistant: 
ðŸ“Š **Compliance Status Overview**

Overall Status: **GOOD**
Compliance Score: **92%**

âœ… Your compliance tracking is up to date!

**Current Tracking:**
â€¢ 8 compliance tasks (7 completed)
â€¢ 12 documents tracked (10 verified)
â€¢ 3 recurring obligations

Would you like me to run a compliance check, review alerts, or dive into any specific area?
```

### Running Checks
```
User: "Run a compliance check"
Assistant: Running comprehensive compliance check...
(Executes API call)
âœ… Compliance check complete. I've updated all tracking items and generated fresh recommendations.
```

### Proactive Alerts
```javascript
// Trigger from external compliance monitoring
if (complianceData.overall_status === 'critical') {
  assistantManager.triggerContextualAssistant('compliance_alert', {
    overdueItems: complianceData.summary.overdue_count,
    expiredDocs: complianceData.summary.expired_documents
  })
}
```

## Integration Points
