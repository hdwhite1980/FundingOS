# Application Creation Foreign Key Fix - Summary

## Problem
Users were getting this error when creating applications:
```
Failed to generate document: insert or update on table 'submissions' violates foreign key constraint 'submissions_opportunity_id_fkey'
```

## Root Cause
- The `submissions` table has a foreign key constraint requiring `opportunity_id` to reference an existing record in the `opportunities` table
- The application creation form (`CreateSubmissionModal`) was not collecting `opportunity_id`, only `opportunity_title` as a text field
- Many existing submissions had `null` values for `opportunity_id`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated CreateSubmissionModal (ApplicationProgress.js)
- Added opportunity selection dropdown that loads from existing opportunities
- Added fallback manual entry field for custom opportunity titles
- Form now collects both `opportunity_id` (when selected) and `opportunity_title`

### 2. Enhanced Application Creation API (app/api/applications/create/route.js)
- Added logic to handle cases where no `opportunity_id` is provided
- Automatically creates or finds a default opportunity: "Manual Entry - Default Opportunity"
- Ensures every new submission always has a valid `opportunity_id`

### 3. Updated Frontend Application Creation (ApplicationProgress.js)
- Modified `handleCreateSubmission` to use the service role API endpoint
- Ensures proper data validation before submission

## Files Modified
1. `/components/ApplicationProgress.js` - Updated modal and submission handling
2. `/app/api/applications/create/route.js` - Enhanced API with auto-opportunity creation
3. `/lib/supabase.js` - Updated to use new service role API endpoint

## Testing
- Created test page at `/test-application` to verify the fix works
- Test creates applications without opportunity_id to ensure auto-creation works
- Should see successful creation without foreign key errors

## Expected Behavior
1. New applications can be created with or without selecting an existing opportunity
2. If no opportunity is selected, a default one is automatically created/used
3. No more foreign key constraint violations
4. Legacy applications with null opportunity_id will be handled by the auto-creation logic when similar records are created

## Legacy Data
- Existing submissions with null opportunity_id will remain as-is
- They don't cause immediate issues but should be cleaned up in a future maintenance task
- The auto-creation logic prevents any new null values

## Next Steps for User
1. Test the application creation in the main app
2. Go to Applications â†’ Track New Application
3. Try creating applications both with and without selecting opportunities
4. Verify no foreign key errors occur
5. Check that submissions are created successfully
