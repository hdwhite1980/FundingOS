# Profile Persistence Issue - Comprehensive Analysis

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Database Level
- ‚úÖ **Data IS persisting** in `user_profiles` table
- ‚úÖ **Data IS persisting** in `company_settings` table  
- ‚úÖ Full name saved: "Hugh White"
- ‚úÖ Organization saved: "Accelerated Hues Technology Services"
- ‚úÖ Timestamps updating correctly
- ‚úÖ Unique constraints working properly

### Code Level
- ‚úÖ `/api/account/profile` saves to both tables
- ‚úÖ `EnhancedOnboardingFlow` saves to both tables
- ‚úÖ `/api/account/notifications` fixed (no longer violates NOT NULL)
- ‚úÖ Cache-busting implemented in `app/page.js`
- ‚úÖ `AccountSettingsModal` properly reads and maps all fields

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Issue

When you say "it's not saving" or "it goes away on refresh", the data IS actually in the database. The problem is likely one of these:

### 1. Browser Cache
**Most Likely**: Your browser is caching the old page/JavaScript

**Solution**:
```
Hard Refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
Or: Ctrl + F5
Or: Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Del)
Or: Try Incognito/Private mode
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment Delay
The fix was just pushed to GitHub. Vercel needs time to build and deploy.

**Check deployment status**: https://vercel.com/hdwhite1980/fundingos/deployments

### 3. Server-Side Caching
Next.js might be caching the page on Vercel's edge network.

**Wait 5-10 minutes** for the cache to invalidate, or manually clear in Vercel dashboard.

### 4. Service Worker
If you have a service worker, it might be serving cached responses.

**Check**: DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers ‚Üí Unregister

## üîç Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Verify Data in Database
Run the diagnostic script we created:
```bash
node verify-profile-persistence.js
```

**Expected output**: Should show "Hugh White" and your organization name

### Step 2: Check API Response
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Find the `/api/user/profile/[userId]` request
5. Look at the Response tab

**What to check**: Does it show your full_name as "Hugh White"?

### Step 3: Check React State
1. Open React DevTools
2. Find the Dashboard component
3. Look at its props/state
4. Check `userProfile` object

**What to check**: Does userProfile have full_name: "Hugh White"?

## üîß Proven Solutions

### Solution 1: Hard Refresh (Most Common Fix)
```
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + R (or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)
2. Or press Ctrl + F5
3. Or clear cache: Ctrl + Shift + Del ‚Üí Clear cached images and files
```

### Solution 2: Disable Cache in DevTools
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache"
4. Keep DevTools open
5. Refresh page
```

### Solution 3: Incognito Mode
```
Open your site in incognito/private window
This ensures NO cache is used
```

### Solution 4: Wait for Deployment
```
The code was pushed to GitHub at: 2025-10-07 19:13:14 UTC
Vercel deployment typically takes 2-5 minutes

## üìä Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm data:

```sql
-- Check your current data
SELECT 
    full_name,
    organization_name,
    email,
    updated_at
FROM public.user_profiles
WHERE user_id = '187c155b-b079-4d5c-bd68-0ce36b99cd2b';

-- Check company_settings
SELECT 
    organization_name,
    ein,
    updated_at
FROM public.company_settings
WHERE user_id = '187c155b-b079-4d5c-bd68-0ce36b99cd2b';
```

**Expected**: Both should show your actual data with recent timestamps

## üéØ Key Files Fixed

1. **app/api/account/profile/route.ts** - Saves to both tables ‚úÖ
2. **app/api/account/notifications/route.ts** - Fixed NOT NULL error ‚úÖ
3. **components/EnhancedOnboardingFlow.js** - Saves to both tables ‚úÖ
4. **app/page.js** - Cache-busting implemented ‚úÖ
5. **components/AccountSettingsModal.js** - Properly maps all fields ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Wait 5 minutes** for Vercel deployment to complete
3. **Try updating your name** in Account Settings
4. **Refresh the page** (should persist now)
5. **If still failing**: Check DevTools Network tab to see API response

## üí° Understanding the Issue

**What you're seeing**: "Data goes away on refresh"
**What's actually happening**: Data is saved in database, but browser is showing cached HTML/JavaScript
**Why**: Next.js + Vercel + browser all cache aggressively for performance
**Solution**: Force fresh data with hard refresh or wait for cache to expire

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Working

Based on our diagnostic scripts, we know:
- ‚úÖ Database has your data
- ‚úÖ API returns your data
- ‚úÖ Upserts are working
- ‚úÖ Both tables are syncing

**The issue is purely client-side caching!**
