  async getOpportunities(filters = {}) {
    // Filters: organizationType, minAmount, maxAmount
    // Returns up to 200 opportunities
  },

  // Get opportunities with eligibility checking
  async getEligibleOpportunities(userProfile, filters = {}) {
    // Applies GrantEligibilityService filtering
    // Filters: onlyEligible, excludeWarnings, minConfidence

    // Includes cached fit scores
  },

  // Save opportunity to project
  async saveOpportunity(projectId, opportunityId, fitScore) {
    // Creates project_opportunities record

## üéØ Scoring System

### Scoring Service Integration (`lib/scoringServiceIntegration.js`)

**Score Calculation:**
```javascript
scoringService.calculateScore(project, opportunity, userProfile)
```

**Caching Strategy:**
- Scores cached in `project_opportunities` table
- Only recalculates when project changes
- Prevents redundant AI calls
- Dramatically improves performance

**Score Breakdown:**
- **0-59**: Red - Poor fit
- **60-79**: Yellow - Moderate fit  
- **80-100**: Green - Excellent fit

**Scoring Factors:**
1. Project alignment with opportunity categories
2. Budget match (project funding goal vs opportunity amounts)
3. Organization type eligibility
4. Past performance and capacity
5. Geographic alignment
6. Timeline feasibility

## üîç Eligibility System

### GrantEligibilityService (`lib/eligibility/grantEligibilityService.js`)

5. Paginates results (20 per page)
6. Calculates AI scores for visible opportunities (current + next page)
7. Renders OpportunityCard components
8. Shows eligibility badges and fit scores
```

## üêõ Known Issues

### Array Field Handling
- `project_types` and `eligibility_criteria` stored as TEXT[]
- Some records have empty arrays `{}`
- Some have double quotes `""`
- Filtering requires careful array operations
- Fixed with safe inspection queries (see `safe_inspection.sql`)

### Performance Considerations
- Scoring 200 opportunities takes ~30 seconds
- Implemented lazy scoring (only visible + next page)
- Cached scores in database
- Pagination reduces initial load time
- Consider background job for bulk scoring

## üìù SQL Queries

### Get Opportunities with Filters
```sql
SELECT *
FROM opportunities
WHERE organization_types && ARRAY['nonprofit']
  AND amount_max >= 50000
  AND deadline > NOW()
ORDER BY deadline ASC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Get Saved Opportunities for Project
```sql
SELECT 
  o.*,
  po.fit_score,
  po.notes,
  po.status,
  po.created_at as saved_at
FROM opportunities o
JOIN project_opportunities po ON po.opportunity_id = o.id
WHERE po.project_id = $1
ORDER BY po.created_at DESC;
```

### Get Eligibility Stats
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE 'nonprofit' = ANY(organization_types)) as nonprofit_eligible,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE amount_max >= 100000) as large_awards,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE deadline > NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days') as upcoming
