# Application Compliance Integration

## Overview
The Enhanced AI Application Tracker now automatically extracts compliance requirements, deadlines, and reporting obligations from grant application documents and integrates them directly into the Compliance Command Center. This ensures that all post-award compliance obligations are automatically tracked from the moment you apply.

## How It Works

### 1. **Document Analysis Phase**
When you upload application documents to the Enhanced Application Tracker:
- The AI reads and analyzes the entire application form
- Extracts all compliance-related requirements, including:
  - Reporting requirements (progress reports, financial reports, etc.)
  - Document requirements (registrations, certificates, insurance, etc.)
  - Recurring obligations (monthly/quarterly reporting schedules)
  - Critical deadlines (submission dates, project milestones)
  - Special conditions (match requirements, spending restrictions)

### 2. **Compliance Extraction**
The system calls the `/api/ai/extract-compliance` endpoint which:
- Uses Claude AI to analyze the document text and form structure
- Identifies specific compliance requirements mentioned in the application
- Categorizes requirements into:
  - **Tracking Items**: One-time or deadline-based tasks
  - **Documents**: Required certificates, registrations, or filings
  - **Recurring Obligations**: Regular reporting schedules

### 3. **Review Before Submission**
In the application review step, you'll see:
- Total count of extracted compliance requirements
- Summary of tracking items, documents, and recurring obligations
- Sample requirements with their descriptions and deadlines
- Visual indicators showing what will be added to Compliance Command Center

### 4. **Automatic Creation**
When you submit the application:
- All extracted compliance requirements are automatically created in the database
- Each item is tagged with:
  - Source: "application"
  - Opportunity title and project information
  - Submission ID for traceability
  - Auto-generated flag for identification

### 5. **Compliance Command Center Integration**
The Compliance Dashboard displays AI-extracted items with:
- **"AI-Extracted" badge** - Visual indicator showing items from applications
- **Source information** - Links back to the originating application/opportunity
- **Full compliance tracking** - Same capabilities as manually-entered items

## File Structure

## Compliance Data Structure

### Extracted Data Format
```javascript
{
  compliance_tracking_items: [
    {
      title: "Quarterly Progress Report",
      compliance_type: "grant_reporting",
      description: "Submit detailed progress report...",
      priority: "high",
      deadline_date: "2025-12-31",
      frequency: "quarterly",
      estimated_hours: 8,
      notes: "Must include financial data"
    }
  ],
  compliance_documents: [
    {
      document_type: "sam_registration",
      document_name: "SAM.gov Active Registration",
      is_required: true,
      expiration_date: "2026-06-30",
      notes: "Must maintain throughout grant period"
    }
  ],
  compliance_recurring: [
    {
      name: "Monthly Financial Report",
      compliance_type: "grant_reporting",
      description: "Monthly reconciliation...",
      frequency: "monthly",
      frequency_interval: 1,
      reminder_days: 7,
      estimated_hours: 4
    }
  ],
  critical_deadlines: [
    {
      deadline: "2025-11-15",
      description: "Application submission deadline",
      type: "application_deadline"
    }
  ],
  special_conditions: [
    {
      condition: "Match requirement",
      description: "25% cash match required",
      category: "financial"
    }
  ],
  summary: {
    total_requirements: 15,
    reporting_frequency: "quarterly",
    audit_required: true,
    complexity_level: "moderate"
  }
}
```

### Database Storage
Each compliance item is stored with metadata:
```javascript
{
  metadata: {
    source: 'application',
    submission_id: '...',
    opportunity_title: 'Grant Name',
    project_id: '...',
    auto_generated: true
  }
}
```
