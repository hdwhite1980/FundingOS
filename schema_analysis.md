# Database Schema Analysis

Based on the schema provided, here are the key findings:

## Tables with `updated_at` column:
- agent_decisions
- agent_goals  
- agent_instances
- agent_learning_patterns

## Tables with timestamp columns but NO `updated_at`:
- agent_activity_log (only created_at)
- agent_conversations (only created_at)
- agent_decision_feedback (only created_at)
- agent_errors (only created_at)
- agent_experiences (only created_at)
- agent_manager_log (only created_at)
- agent_notifications (only created_at)
- agent_opportunity_evaluations (only created_at)

## Missing Key Tables:
The schema only shows "agent_*" tables. I don't see critical tables like:
- opportunities
- projects
- user_profiles
- users
- angel_investments
- etc.

## Analysis:
1. **Limited scope**: This appears to be only the agent-related tables
2. **Inconsistent timestamp patterns**: Some tables have both created_at/updated_at, others only created_at
3. **Missing core business tables**: The opportunities table that was causing the sync error is not visible here

## Questions:
1. Is this the complete schema or just a subset?
2. Where are the core business tables (opportunities, projects, user_profiles)?
3. Are there multiple schemas or databases?

## Recommendations:
1. Get the complete table list including non-agent tables
2. Check if opportunities table exists in a different schema
3. Verify which tables actually need updated_at triggers
